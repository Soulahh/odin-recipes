    <ol>
        <li> In a large pot, combine the sweet condensed milk and 3 cups of the milk.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the corn starch in one cup of milk and add to the pot.</li>
        <li>Cook that mixture over low to medium heat, stirring constantly, until it starts thickening.</li>
        <li>Separate a cup of the mixture and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolks to the cooled cream and return it to the pot, cooking until it thickens.</li>
        <li>Let it cool and pour into a 15x10 baking dish</li>
        <li>Place the biscuits into a large bowl and the Cognac into another smaller bowl.</li>
        <li>Using your fingers, sprinkle the Cognac onto the biscuits.</li>
        <li>In the same pot you used for the cream, add 2 cups of milk and 1.5 cups of cocoa powder. Cook until it resembles hot chocolate. (It's supposed to be a liquid mixture, and not a cream!)</li>
